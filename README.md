The Smart Approval Optimization Tool is a web-based application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The primary goal of this system is to digitize, streamline, and optimize the leave request and approval process in educational institutions or organizations.
The tool reduces manual paperwork, improves transparency, enforces approval rules automatically, and ensures faster decision-making through a structured and role-based workflow.

Future Enhancements:
1.AI-based leave approval recommendations
2.Mobile application support
3.Notification system (Email/SMS)
4.Analytics dashboard for administrators
